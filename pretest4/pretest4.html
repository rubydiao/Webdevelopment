<h1>Inline Elements</h1>

<div>
    <p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a
        paragraph or division.  Each element does different things to the text.
        <strong>This text is in a strong element</strong>.
        <b>This text is in a bold (b) element</b>. Bold and strong seem to have the
        same effect.  <em>This is emphasised (em) text</em>.  It seems to look the same
        as this <i>italicized text here</i>.</p>
        
        <p>Putting text inside quote elements, <q>like this quoted text here</q>,
        makes the text display with quotation marks around it.  Code (code) tags are
        meant source code examples. They look like <code>code text here</code>. The
        keyboard element (kbd) looks the same, <kbd>keyboard text here</kbd>, but is
        meant for examples of user entered data.</p>
        
        <p>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.  <sup>this is
        superscript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript</sub>.</p>
        
        <p>Span <span>elements</span> don't <span>seem to</span> do anything
        <span>at all</span>.  I've <span>put</span> about every <span>other</span>
        inside <span>span</span> tags.  Can you tell which is which?</p>
